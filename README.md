# codeacademy sql: trends-in-start-ups
I am a  TechCrunch reporter. My first task is to write an article on the rising trends in the startup world.

To get you started with my research, my boss emailed me a project.sqlite file that contains a table called startups. It is a portfolio of some of the biggest names in the industry.

I write queries with aggregate functions to retrieve some interesting insights about these companies.
